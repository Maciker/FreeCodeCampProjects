<!-- Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx.
Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.

User Story #1: My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.
User Story #2: I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").
User Story #3: I should see a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".
User Story #4: Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".
User Story #5: Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.
User Story #6: I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.
User Story #7: I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank").
User Story #8: The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
User Story #9: The img element should be centered within its parent element.

		<h3>Early life:</h3> <p>Robert Anthony De Niro Jr. was born on August 17, 1943, in the Manhattan borough of New York City, the only child of painters Virginia Admiral and Robert De Niro Sr. He is of Irish and Italian descent on his father's side,while his mother had Dutch, English, French, and German ancestry.<br></p>
		<h3>Acting style and legacy</h3> <p>De Niro studied with Stella Adler, from whom he learned about the techniques of the Stanislavski system. The technique encouraged him to explore both internal and external aspects to fully realize the character being portrayed. He is praised for his commitment to roles; he gained 60 lb (27 kg) and learned how to box for his role as Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull, ground his teeth down for Cape Fear, lived in Sicily for The Godfather Part II, worked as a cab driver for a few weeks for Taxi Driver, and learned to play the saxophone for New York, New York. He again put on weight for his performance as Al Capone in The Untouchables.<br></p>
		<h3>Political activism</h3> <p>In 1998, he lobbied Congress against impeaching President Bill Clinton.<br>While promoting the film The Good Shepherd with co-star Matt Damon on the December 8, 2006, episode of Hardball with Chris Matthews at George Mason University, De Niro was asked whom he would like to see as President of the United States. De Niro responded, "Well, I think of two people: Hillary Clinton and Obama." On February 4, 2008, De Niro supported Obama at a rally at the Izod Center in New Jersey before Super Tuesday.<br>In 2012, De Niro joined the anti-fracking campaign Artists Against Fracking.<br>During the 2016 presidential campaign, De Niro was an outspoken critic of then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, calling him "so blatantly stupid" and stating, "He wants to punch people in the face?! I'd like to punch him in the face." This was in reference to the similar desire Trump expressed towards protestors at one of his rallies.<br>On June 10, 2018, while introducing a performance by Bruce Springsteen of his song "My Hometown" at the 72nd Tony Awards, De Niro brought the audience to a standing ovation with this denunciation of President Trump:<br>I'm gonna say one thing. Fuck Trump. It's no longer "down with Trump". It's "fuck Trump".<br>A day later, in front of a crowd in Toronto, he apologized to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for President Trump's "idiotic behavior".<br></p>
